+\r\n\r\n        //       '\\t高峰介绍，在促进商品消费方面，将鼓励相关地区优化汽车限购措施，开展新一轮汽车下乡和以旧换新；落实全面取消二手车限迁政策，健全报废汽车回收利用体系；积极发展汽车养护、维修、保险、租赁等汽车后市场，畅通新车、二手车、报废汽车的流通循环。\\n' +\r\n\r\n        //       '\\t另外，还将鼓励有条件的地方对淘汰旧家电家具并购买绿色智能家电、环保家具给予补贴；鼓励发展“互联网+废旧物资回收”新模式，促进家电家具等更新换代。\\n' +\r\n\r\n        //       '\\t近期，汽车家电等大宗商品消费利好不断。11月18日召开的国务院常务会议提出，要稳定和扩大汽车消费。鼓励各地调整优化限购措施，增加号牌指标投放。要促进家电家具家装消费。鼓励有条件的地区对淘汰旧家电家具并购买绿色智能家电、环保家具给予补贴。\\n' +\r\n\r\n        //       '\\t随后，商务部针对以上领域进行重点部署，明确将深化汽车流通体制改革，畅通新车、二手车、报废汽车、汽车进出口等内外循环，推动汽车由购买管理向使用管理转变，加快修订《二手车流通管理办法》，落实全面取消二手车限迁政策，进一步活跃二手车市场。同时，将鼓励各地尽快出台相应方案，落实优化限购、增加号牌指标投放、鼓励家电家具更新换代等政策，进一步激活消费市场。\\n' +\r\n\r\n        //       '\\t政策带动之下，市场有望加速回暖。根据中国汽车工业协会日前统计的重点企业旬报情况预估，11月中国汽车行业销量预估完成273.3万辆，环比增长6.2%，同比增长11.1%。另外，市场预计，随着鼓励举措落地，叠加10月房地产新开工和竣工单月增速再次转正利好，家电家具消费也有望加速回升。\\n' +\r\n\r\n        //       '\\t餐饮消费也成为接下来的促消费重点。高峰表示，商务部将在指导督促餐饮行业抓好疫情防控的同时，鼓励企业弘扬传统特色，创新提升菜品，推介优质特色餐饮；指导企业创新运营模式，推进线上线下融合，积极发展在线下单、无接触配送等餐饮消费新模式。同时，出台坚决制止餐饮浪费的政策举措，完善促进餐饮节约和绿色发展的标准体系，优化餐饮经营服务规范，营造良好的餐饮消费环境。\\n'\r\n      },\r\n
